## Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is all about being open to improvement and learning. Intelligence and talent are not something we are born with, but something we can work towards achieving.  You should not be afraid of change or avoid learning when things get dificult. You should not be jealous of coworkers that are "smarter" or "more sucessful" than you, instead embrace them as part of the team and try to learn from them. You should try to avoid falling into common traps like giving into to distractions when the going gets tough or being envious of your co-workers. Above all you should be a lifelong learner and work together
