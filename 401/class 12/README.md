Entity Framework (EF) Core is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework developed by Microsoft. It allows developers to work with databases using .NET objects, making data access and manipulation easier in ASP.NET MVC web applications. Below are some reading notes to get you started with EF Core in an ASP.NET MVC web app:

**Install EF Core:**

Begin by creating a new ASP.NET MVC project in Visual Studio or your preferred development environment. Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed.
To use EF Core, you need to install the EF Core NuGet package. You can do this using NuGet Package Manager Console with the following command:

```Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore```

**Create Data Model:**

Define your data model classes that represent the tables in your database. These classes will become the entities in EF Core. Annotate them with attributes to specify relationships, key fields, and other metadata.
```
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

**DbContext Class:**

Create a class that derives from DbContext. This class represents your database context and is responsible for interacting with the database using EF Core.

```
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
}
```
**Connection String:**

In your appsettings.json file (or appsettings.Development.json for development environment), specify the connection string for your database. The DbContext will use this connection string to connect to the database.
Example of appsettings.json:
```
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
    }
}
```
**Dependency Injection:**

Register your DbContext in the dependency injection container so that it can be injected into controllers or other classes that need to work with the database.
In Startup.cs, add the following code to the ConfigureServices method:

```
services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```  

**Database Migration:**

EF Core can automatically create the database schema based on your data model classes. To do this, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:
```
Update-Database
CRUD Operations:
```

Now that your data model, context, and database are set up, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using EF Core in your ASP.NET MVC controllers and views.
For example, to retrieve a list of products from the database:

```
public class ProductController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public ProductController(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var products = _dbContext.Products.ToList();
        return View(products);
    }
}
```
