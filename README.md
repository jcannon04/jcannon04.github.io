#### Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is all about being open to improvement and learning. Intelligence and talent are not something we are born with, but something we can work towards achieving.  You should not be afraid of change or avoid learning when things get dificult. You should not be jealous of coworkers that are "smarter" or "more sucessful" than you, instead embrace them as part of the team and try to learn from them. You should try to avoid falling into common traps like giving into to distractions when the going gets tough or being envious of your co-workers. Above all you should be a lifelong learner and work together

#### 3 Growth reminders

* Stay Focused - Don't give into temptation. Be aware when you are just trying to avoid hardwork and remember no pain no gain.

* Be Inspired - Be inspired by the success and knowledge of your coworkers. Don't be envious it gets you nowhere

* Listen - Don't get mad when you hear criticism. Listen and determin if you can learn from what people have to say
