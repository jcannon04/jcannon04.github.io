# Unit Testing and Documentation

* **Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity**

* Bug detection and prevention: Unit testing helps to identify bugs and issues in the code early on, allowing developers to fix them

* Code maintainability: Unit tests act as documentation for the codebase, providing examples of how to use different functions and components.

* Productivity and confidence: Unit testing allows developers to verify the correctness of their code quickly and automatically. 

* **How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry** Determine what the expected outcome should be when the task is performed correctly. All the clothes are placed in the correct location. Simulate the input with a list of clothes and check the output by making sure all the cloths are placed in the correct locations.
* **Name 3 reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code.** It saves time and effort by explaing how your codes works, so developers don't have to dig through your code base to get up and running. It can attract users and contributors boosting your project. It can help with troubleshooting and debugging and give users a more positive experience.
* **When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include.** Installation Instructions, Purpose/ Overview, Usage Examples, API Docs
