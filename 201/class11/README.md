## Reading Q&A

* **Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.** We used to have to use 3rd party plugins like silverlight and flash to include audio and video in a web pages. This made it much more difficult for developers to create and maintain websites that included content other than text. Now we have audio and video tags so we can easily add this type of content anywhere we want directly in our pages without the need of 3rd party services.

* **Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.** Audio and Video are childhood friends that used to get bullied by mean mr flash. They grew up and got stronger. So much stronger that HTML co hired them to fight off their arch nemesis and put him out of business so he would never bother any poor web developer again
