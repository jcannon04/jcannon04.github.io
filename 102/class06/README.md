# Dynamic Web Pages With Javascript

Javascript is an interpreted, prototype based, single threaded programming language. It is also multi-paradigm meaning it supports object oriented, functional and procedural style programming. Traditionally Javascript has been used as a scripting language for the web. Now it is also used server side with Nodes JS and other platforms/ frameworks

Javascript can be broken into 3 main parts

* The language - standard among different environment and defined by ECMA
* DOM API - How the language interacts with the browser / client side
* Server API - provided by NODE.js is used for building back-end programs in Javascript

Three ways to output in Javascript:

* `alert()` opens a popup and outputs the string provided as a parameter
* `document.write()` writes to page sourcecode after the first line before the last line. Can be used to add HTML to your page dynamically
* `console.log()` this command prints out a message in the JavaScript console you are using. Usually messages for the developer
