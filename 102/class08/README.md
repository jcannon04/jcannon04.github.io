# Operators and Loops
Expressions in JavaScript are combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluate to a single value. The simplest example of an expression is a literal value, such as 5 or "Hello World". More complex expressions can include multiple values and operators, such as:

```javascript
2 + 3 * 4
```

In JavaScript, there are several types of operators that can be used to build expressions:


## Arithmetic Operators: 

These operators perform arithmetic operations on numbers. For example: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), ++ (increment), and -- (decrement).

## Comparison Operators: 

These operators compare values and return a Boolean value (true or false). For example: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to).

## Logical Operators: 

These operators are used to combine the results of multiple comparisons. For example: && (and), || (or), and ! (not).

## Assignment Operators: 

These operators are used to assign values to variables. For example: = (assign), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), and *= (multiply and assign).

## String Operators: 

These operators are used to concatenate (combine) strings. For example: + (concatenate).

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator: 

This operator is a shorthand way to write an if statement that returns a value. The syntax is condition ? value if true : value if false.

## Spread Operator:

This operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected. The syntax is ...array
