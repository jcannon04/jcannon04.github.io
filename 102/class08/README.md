# Operators and Loops
## Comparison operators 

symbols used in JavaScript to compare two values and determine whether they are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to each other.

## Assignment operators 

used to assign values to variables in JavaScript. These operators include "=", "+=", "-=", "*=", "/=", "%=", and others. They perform the operation on the value on the right-hand side of the operator and assign the result to the variable on the left-hand side.

## For loops 

used to execute a block of code a specific number of times in JavaScript. They consist of three parts: an initialization expression, a condition expression, and an iteration expression. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition expression is true, and the iteration expression is executed after each iteration of the loop.

## While loops 

used to execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is true in JavaScript. They consist of a single condition expression, and the loop will continue to run as long as the expression is true. The expression is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, and if it is false, the loop will terminate.
