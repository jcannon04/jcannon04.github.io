#### Growth Mindset

Those with a growth mindset believe that intelligence and talent are not fixed traits. They can be developed through perseverance and effort. Everyone encounters challenges, and when faced with adversity, many people give up or try to avoid the issue at hand. Having a growth mindset will allow you to embrace the challenge, learn to be mindful of your avoidance and instead continue through until you complete the objective. When someone encounters an obstacle they will often try to avoid it completely. They will go grab a cup of coffee or vacuum their living room, or anything to distract themselves. While those with a growth mindset can resist the temptation of instant gratification and continue with the task in front of them. When the alarm clock goes off early in the morning it can be tempting to hit the snooze button when you realize how much effort it requires to get out of bed and go to work, or you can jump out of bed and seize the day. Because you know that you can sweat a little now and then enjoy a sense of accomplishment, or you can stay in bed and suffer from regret later on. The right choice is obvious. It's not even a real question for someone that has come to accept and embrace the growth mindset. It's easy to hear about what you did right, but it can be disheartening and evening aggravating to hear what you've done wrong. With a growth mindset you can understand that every one makes mistakes and does sub optimal work sometimes, and even if you don't think you do there is always room for improvement. Feedback and constructive criticism give you the knowledge you need to grow, learn and move forward. When you see a coworker excel at work, become successful, move up the corporate latter and seemingly achieve what you cannot, it can be tempting to be envious and let it effect your self of esteem. Those that have acquired a growth mindset can take a step back and realize that kind of thinking is thinking is toxic and only holds them back. You should instead look to that person as an inspiration and see what you can learn from. Use them as part of your mental model for achievement. The growth mindset is all about being mindful when you start displaying negative thoughts and behaviors and turn them on their head so that you can work towards being the person you know you can become.

#### Growth reminders

* Stay Focused - Don't give into temptation. Be aware when you are just trying to avoid hard work and remember no pain no gain.

* Be Inspired - Be inspired by the success and knowledge of your coworkers. Don't be envious it gets you nowhere

* Listen - Don't get mad when you hear criticism. Listen and determine if you can learn from what people have to say

* Challenge Accepted - Embrace the challenging aspects of your work. Again, stay focused on the end goal and see it through
