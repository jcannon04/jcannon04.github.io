## Dependency Injection
An technique in software engineering where you provide (inject) dependencies into an object that needs it instead of having that object create the dependency itself. You can the object it's dependencies through it's constructor or via a setter method.

## Repository Pattern
The Repository Design Pattern Mediates between the domain and the data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing the domain objects.
In other words, we can say that a Repository Design Pattern acts as a middleman or middle layer between the rest of the application and the data access logic.

## SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility**
- A class should have a single responsibility

**Open-Closed**
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

**Liskov's Substitution**
- If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.


**Interface Segregation**
- Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

**Dependency Inversion**
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.

- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
