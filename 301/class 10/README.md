* **What is a ‘call’?** synonymous with invocation. It is when a function is ran.
* **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?** Because the callstack is single threaded, only one call can happen at a time.
* **What does LIFO mean?** last in first out. The last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
* **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.** 
* **What causes a Stack Overflow?** A stack overflow occurs when the call stack exceeds its maximum limit. Either by infinite recursion, or by a very large number of nested functions or infinite loop.
* **What is a ‘reference error’?** A reference error occurs when you try to access a variable or function that does not exist or is not in scope. 
* **What is a ‘syntax error’?** A syntax error occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language's syntax.
* **What is a ‘range error’?** A range error occurs when you use a value that is outside the range of acceptable values for a variable or function.
* **What is a ‘type error’?** A type error occurs when an operation is performed on a value of an incompatible type. It indicates that the code is trying to use or manipulate a value in a way that is not supported by its data type.
* **What is a breakpoint?** A breakpoint is a marker set in the code by a developer to pause the execution of a program at a specific line or statement. 
* **What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?** It sets a breakpoint in your code so that you can start debugging.
