# Debugging

## Reading Q&A
* **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.** A syntax error is like a typo. You typed something that is not valid javascript and you will get an error. A logic error is an error that doesn't necessarily keep your code from running but you get unexpected results

* **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.** A lot of reference and type error. They happen you reference something at a point in your code when it's out of scope. I have corrected these errors by returning values from functions or moving variable to the global scope

* **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?** Running into error is something that will happen during my entire career. Learning how to correct these errors is one of the most important aspects of programming

* **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?** Your development tools help you track down problems in your code. They allow you to run your code line by and see exactly what you are doing wrong. They also display errors that might be in your code.

* **Define what a breakpoint is.** A break point is a feature of a debugger where you can mark a line of code in which to stop execution and use the debugger to step through your code line by line.

* **What is the call stack?** The call stack is a list of function calls in your code and starting with the first function call and ending with the last.
