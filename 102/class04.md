# Structure Web Pages With HTML

## Wireframe And Design

wireframing is a process in UX Design. The basic idea is to layout the look of a website or app. They are used to get an idea about how an app should look for the user. They can be made with wireframing software and design tools or a blackboard/piece of paper
Some projects go from wireframe right to code, while others might build a prototype or have more design steps in between wireframe to product. You should always think about the customer user experience when deciding how your app will be laid out. Do not get caught in details like colors and fonts only the basice outline.

## HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to add structure to the content of your website. It is not a programming language and doesnt contain any logical commands it doesnt provide functionality instead describes the format of your site using tags and their attribute to define the content they are wrapping

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets are used to add style to your webpage. This includes, colors, fonts, animations, display and layout, and much much more. Where html tells you what your content is and divides it into logical sections. CSS tells the browser what it should look like. To do this you select HTML elements with css selector and use css to style them.

## Semantics

Semantics in coding refer to the meaning of the code you write and not what it looks like or how it is organized on screen. HTML5 has many different semantic tags to give more meaning to your html tags. They also lead to better SEO and help with user accessibility.
