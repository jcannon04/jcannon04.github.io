# Revisions and The Cloud

## Version Control

Version control systems allows you to keep track of changes in a file or set of files. They allow you to see what changes have been made over time and enable yo to
revert to an older version if need be. 

### Local Version Control

older VCS were local meaning there was only one database on your local computer to track changes

### Centralized Version Control

Centralized Version Control Systems allowed collaboration by storing the files on a server and allowing everyone on the same project to see others work and they
allowed administrator to divy up the work more efficiently. Central server instead of a collection of local databases

### Distributed Version Control

Addresses the major issue with a CVS. All the files for a project on a server creates a single point of failure and can result in catostropic loss of data.
DVCS creates back ups mirrors of the project to reduce the chance of loosing data.
